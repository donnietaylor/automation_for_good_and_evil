# Automation for Good and Evil 🤖😈😇

A repository showcasing the power of Azure and AI-based automations through humorous and entertaining demonstrations of how automation can be used for both "good" and "evil" purposes.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository contains code, demos, and presentation materials that demonstrate:
- How Azure-based automations can streamline (or complicate) daily tasks
- The power and potential pitfalls of AI-driven workflows
- Creative uses of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers
- Workflow automation with n8n and Langflow
- Funny and hilarious real-world scenarios where automation helps or "hinders"

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Azure subscription (for Azure automation examples)
- Node.js 18+ (for MCP servers)
- Docker (for containerized demos)
- Python 3.9+ (for AI examples)
- n8n instance (optional, for workflow demos)

### Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/donnietaylor/automation_for_good_and_evil.git
   cd automation_for_good_and_evil
   ```

2. Explore the different sections:
   - Check out `/demos` for ready-to-run examples
   - Review `/presentations` for slide materials
   - Dive into specific technology folders for detailed examples

3. Follow the README in each subdirectory for specific setup instructions

## 💡 Example Scenarios

### Good Automations 😇
- Automated code reviews that actually help
- Smart email sorting and response suggestions
- Intelligent meeting scheduling that respects work-life balance
- Automated testing and deployment pipelines

### "Evil" Automations 😈
- Auto-responders that are *too* enthusiastic
- Meeting bots that schedule conflicts
- Code formatters that use tabs instead of spaces (or vice versa!)
- Automated reminders that never stop reminding

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Azure**: Logic Apps, Functions, DevOps Pipelines
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI, Azure AI Services, various LLMs
- **Automation Tools**: n8n, Langflow
