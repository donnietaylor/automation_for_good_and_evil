# Automation for Good… and Evil

A repository showcasing real-time automation and AI-driven workflows that can genuinely help communities, nonprofits, and civic efforts—or power playful, harmless mischief when the moment is right.

## Purpose

**Automation isn't inherently good or evil. It's just power, and what matters is how we choose to use it.**

This repository demonstrates how to build systems that react in real time to people, events, and environmental signals. You'll see how the same automation patterns can make a real difference for communities or enable clever, well-timed shenanigans.

### What This Repository Contains

- **Real-time automation** examples that respond to events, people, and environmental signals
- **AI-driven workflows** for community support and playful chaos
- **Practical patterns** you can use to help local organizations or engineer harmless mischief
- **Live demos** showing good first, chaos second—all powered by the same automation engine

## Session Takeaways

1. **Real-Time Reactions** - How to build automations that react in real time to people, events, or environmental signals
2. **AI-Driven Workflows** - Patterns for designing AI-driven workflows that can support communities or power clever, well-timed chaos
3. **Everyday Skills, Extraordinary Impact** - Ways to turn everyday automation skills into tools that help people or enable memorable, playful chaos
4. **Practical Applications** - Ideas you can put to work right away, whether supporting local organizations or engineering harmless mischief

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Azure subscription (for Azure automation examples)
- Node.js 18+ (for MCP servers)
- Docker (for containerized demos)
- Python 3.9+ (for AI examples)
- n8n instance (optional, for workflow demos)

### Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/donnietaylor/automation_for_good_and_evil.git
   cd automation_for_good_and_evil
   ```

2. Explore the different sections:
   - Check out `/demos` for ready-to-run examples
   - Review `/presentations` for slide materials
   - Dive into specific technology folders for detailed examples

3. Follow the README in each subdirectory for specific setup instructions

## Example Scenarios

### Good Automations (Community & Civic Impact)
- **Real-time alert systems** for community emergencies or events
- **Nonprofit support bots** that help with volunteer coordination
- **Accessibility tools** that make content more inclusive in real time
- **Environmental monitoring** that triggers alerts based on sensor data
- **Community resource matching** connecting people with local services
- **Automated code reviews** that genuinely improve project quality

### "Evil" Automations (Playful Chaos)
- **Over-enthusiastic bots** that respond to EVERYTHING with too much excitement
- **Meeting chaos generators** (for harmless demo purposes!)
- **Emoji overload systems** that transform serious text into chaos
- **Format wars bots** that playfully switch coding styles
- **Well-timed shenanigans** that create memorable (but harmless) moments

## Technologies Used

- **Azure**: Logic Apps, Functions, Event Grid (for real-time triggers)
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI, Azure AI Services, LangChain, various LLMs
- **Automation Tools**: n8n, Langflow, MCP servers
- **Real-Time Systems**: Webhooks, Event-driven architectures, IoT sensors
- **Integration**: REST APIs, WebSockets, message queues
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, PowerShell

## Contributing

This is primarily a demonstration repository, but if you have funny automation ideas to add:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Add your automation example
4. Submit a pull request with a good description

## Disclaimer

All "evil" examples are meant to be humorous, playful, and educational. They demonstrate well-timed shenanigans and harmless mischief—nothing that causes actual harm or significant inconvenience. 

Please use automation responsibly and ethically in real-world scenarios. Focus on building systems that help communities first, and save the chaos for appropriate moments!
