# Presentation Materials

This directory contains slide decks, speaker notes, and presentation resources for **"Automation for Good… and Evil"** talks.

## Session Overview

**Automation isn't inherently good or evil. It's just power, and what matters is how we choose to use it.**

This session demonstrates how automation and AI can genuinely help communities, nonprofits, and civic efforts—and how those same skills can power well-timed shenanigans and playful chaos. Good first, chaos second, all powered by the same automation engine.

## Speaker Notes

### Opening Hook
Start with a powerful example of automation helping a real community or nonprofit—show the impact first. Then contrast with a funny example of harmless chaos to set the tone for the session.

### Demo Tips
- Always have a backup video recording of demos
- Test WiFi connectivity before presenting
- Have API keys pre-loaded in environment variables
- Practice transitions between slides and live demos

### Key Messages
1. **Automation is power** - It's not good or evil, it's how you use it
2. **Real-time reactions matter** - Build systems that respond to people, events, and environment
3. **Community first** - Use automation to genuinely help before adding chaos
4. **Same patterns, different purposes** - The skills transfer both ways
5. **Start practical** - You can implement these ideas right away
6. **Have fun responsibly** - Playful chaos should be harmless and well-timed
